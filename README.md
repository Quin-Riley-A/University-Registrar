Last portion we were working on was errors related to students details and courses details
both are throwing errors related to expected vs. received arguments
- to check errors run dotnet build
- errors may be related to lack of a join table; should finish refactoring project to create a join table and then migrate database to include new table


Jan 10:
- Finish DeleteJoin method for CoursesController
- Add additional CRUD functionality to StudentsController
- Migrate database to include join table
- Finalize views for Courses and Students;
